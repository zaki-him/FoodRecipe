FoodRecipe

This is my second experience using React.js.

Throughout this simple project , I've learned how to navigate through components and how to use the Link property

Also I've learned the BrowserRouter property to navigate without loading the pages

Even though the lack of CSS , I've used this project to learn more about how React actually work , and I'm willing to improve my skills as soon as possible
